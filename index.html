            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Rotating locomotion in living systems includes both the rolling of
                entire organisms, and the use of structures that propel by rotating relative to a fixed body, such as a
                wheel or propeller. Though the former mode is used by varied forms of life, including pangolins and
                tumbleweeds, the latter is only known to occur in bacteria using microscopic, corkscrew-like flagella.
                While other human technologies, like wings and lenses, have common natural analogues, multicellular
                organisms have apparently never evolved rotating propulsive structures. Such structures may be
                infeasible to grow and maintain with biological processes. </p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
                traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to
                achieve. A further issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the student
                is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from
                indoctrination. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The
                term can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the
                academic field studying education. </p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education socializes children into society by teaching cultural values
                and norms. It equips them with the skills needed to become productive members of society. This way, it
                stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized institutions
                affect many aspects of education. For example, governments set education policies. They determine when
                school classes happen, what is taught, and who can or must attend. International organizations, like
                UNESCO, have been influential in promoting primary education for all children. Many factors influence
                whether education is successful. Psychological factors include motivation, intelligence, and
                personality. </p>
